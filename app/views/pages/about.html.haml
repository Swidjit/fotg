    %h3 About Free Online Typing Games
    %p FreeOnlineTypingGames.com is an offshoot of my main gaming site, PlayWithYourMind.com, focusing of course on typing games. In total, there are over 10 different typing exercises to explore, placing the Keyboard Playground as one of the top destinations on the web for typing games and typing tests. It is designed to be different things for different people, depending on your skills. On the one hand, if you need practice, these typing games are a great way to learn your keyboard while also having some fun. On the other hand, if you already have considerable typing skills, you can register for the score tracking, enter into some competition, and find how how fast your fingers really are.

Hopefully the improved organization and love will bring more visitors and a healthy competitive environment.
